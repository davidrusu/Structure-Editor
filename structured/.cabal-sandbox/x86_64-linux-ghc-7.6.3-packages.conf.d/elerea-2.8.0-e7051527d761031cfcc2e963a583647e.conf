synopsis: A minimalistic FRP library
description: Elerea (Eventless reactivity) is a tiny discrete time FRP
             implementation without the notion of event-based switching and
             sampling, with first-class signals (time-varying values).  Reactivity
             is provided through various higher-order constructs that also allow
             the user to work with arbitrary time-varying structures containing
             live signals.  Signals have precise and simple denotational
             semantics.
             .
             Stateful signals can be safely generated at any time through a
             monadic interface, while stateless combinators can be used in a
             purely applicative style.  Elerea signals can be defined recursively,
             and external input is trivial to attach.  The library comes in three
             major variants:
             .
             * Simple: signals are plain discrete streams isomorphic to functions
             over natural numbers;
             .
             * Param: adds a globally accessible input signal for convenience;
             .
             * Clocked: adds the ability to freeze whole subnetworks at will.
             .
             This is a minimal library that defines only some basic primitives,
             and you are advised to install @elerea-examples@ as well to get an
             idea how to build non-trivial systems with it.  The examples are
             separated in order to minimise the dependencies of the core library.
             The @dow@ package contains a full game built on top of the simple
             variant.
             .
             The basic idea of the implementation is described in the WFLP 2010
             paper /Efficient and Compositional Higher-Order Streams/
             (<http://sgate.emt.bme.hu/documents/patai/publications/PataiWFLP2010.pdf>).
